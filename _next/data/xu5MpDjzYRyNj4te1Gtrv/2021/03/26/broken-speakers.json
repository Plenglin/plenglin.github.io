They worked pretty well until one day, the audio was extremely loud and the potentiometer was not able to turn the sound down, so I had to either run my audio at 4% or not at all.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/z506.jpg\" alt=\"The Z506 Speakers from Logitech.\">\n<p>That’s not good. Let’s fix that!</p>\n<h2 id=\"wild-conjecturing-as-to-what-went-wrong\">Wild Conjecturing as to What Went Wrong</h2>\n<p>I’m not an audio or electrical engineer, but I had a few guesses as to what might have gone wrong.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the control speaker is connected to the subwoofer with a D-sub connector, I suspected that maybe the subwoofer is the one doing the volume control, and maybe something on there broke.</li>\n<li>A component in the control speaker may broken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I decided to open up the control speaker and check that first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-it-up\">Opening it up</h2>\n<p>I removed the six bolts on the front, and slowly pried the case open.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/010-open-back.jpg\" alt=\"Opening the case.\">\n<p>I pulled it fully open and disconnected the speaker and the connector. However, the case was still refusing to budge.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/020-removed-bolts.jpg\" alt=\"All the bolts have been removed.\">\n<p>It turns out that I had forgot to free the potentiometer’s nut and washer on the front of the case!</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/030-pot-stuck.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Getting rid of that made the chip much easier to remove.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/040-rm-pot-washers.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<h2 id=\"staring-at-the-chip\">Staring at the Chip</h2>\n<p>Here’s what the chip looks like. This was a strange and very tall pot that I had never seen before. After a bit of research, I found that it was a dual-gang potentiometer. Essentially, that that means is that it’s pretty much the same as a normal potentiometer, but the same shaft controls 2 separate potentiometers simultaenously, one for each ear.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/060-chip-top.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/060-chip-side.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/060-chip-bottom.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I began making measurements on it, to make sure that it was working.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/070-measurement.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>As advertised, this is was a <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi>k</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">20k\\Omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">20</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03148em;\">k</span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span></span></span></span></span> potentiometer, give or take a <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">k\\Omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03148em;\">k</span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span></span></span></span></span>. However, when I tried measuring the resistance of the middle leads, I noticed that the bottom one changed resistance as I turned the potentiometer, but the top one didn’t. I thought I was maybe measuring it wrong, or my leads were broken, so I swapped leads and noticeD the same thing. Very strange.</p>\n<p>Rotary potentiometers have a wiper inside that moves when you spin the shaft, controlling the resistance. I stared inside, and saw that the bottom one moved as expected. However, I didn’t even see a wiper for the top one!</p>\n<p>I thought my eyes were deceiving me, so I desoldered and pried open the potentiometer. And sure enough, the top gang was missing its wiper!</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/090-pot-top.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/080-pot-open.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>It seems I’ll need to replace this potentiometer. I desoldered the rest of it off, and ordered a new one from online.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/2021/03/26/broken-speakers/100-remove-pot.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>My initial guesses were both way off the mark. It was something even more basic, even more fundamental than some component somewhere frying: it was a mechanical issue inside the potentiometer.</p>\n<p>I’ll follow up with a post about the repair when the new potentiometer arrives.</p>","tags":["electrical-engineering"]}},"__N_SSG":true}

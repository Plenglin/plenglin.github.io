Unfortunately, this project was scrapped because it turns out that CR servos do not offer very precise movement required for an omniwheel drive.</p>\n<p>However, I was able to program a PID system to make the robot keep facing the same direction even when it is disturbed, as seen in the following GIF.</p>\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/Js2rsqtkQ4EMXftQDa\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/Js2rsqtkQ4EMXftQDa\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"prototypes\">Prototypes</h2>\n<p>Here is an early prototype wheel.

In addition, the TPU was hollow to provide a sort of bounciness to it.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/projects/kiwibot/lower-deck-assembled.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the lower deck, showing the orange TPU mini wheels.\">\n<h2 id=\"assembly\">Assembly</h2>\n<p>The lower deck holds the motors.</p>\n<img src=\"/_/projects/kiwibot/lower-deck.jpg\" alt=\"An image of the lower deck\">\n<p>The upper deck holds the controls.

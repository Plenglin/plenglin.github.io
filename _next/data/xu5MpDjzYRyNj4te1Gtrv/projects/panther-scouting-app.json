Electronic scouting records are simply easier to perform statistical analysis on than paper records, but at most events, Wi-Fi hotspots are prohibited. This means you canâ€™t use Google Drive or a custom website unless you want to depend on expensive data plans or have all the scouts work on one computer. Thus, you need to use different communication protocols.</p>\n<p>This app was able to communicate data between multiple phones using a server-client architecture. It was eventually scrapped because I decided it was too difficult to finish in the few months I had before competition.</p>","tags":["android","bluetooth","client-server","cross-platform","java","kotlin"]},"similar":[{"slug":"kiwibot","title":"KiwiBot"},{"slug":"space-admiral","title":"Space Admiral"},{"slug":"quest-of-con","title":"Quest of Con"},{"slug":"goggle-epoxy","title":"Goggle Epoxy"}]},"__N_SSG":true}

However, <a href=\"https://astrid.tech/blog/2020-12-20-adding-a-backend/#replacing-gatsby\">I am considering moving off of it to Next.js</a>.</p>\n<p>The static site is hosted via <a href=\"https://github.com/astralbijection/astrid.tech\">Github Pages</a> to statically host the website. (Going to <a href=\"https://astralbijection.github.io/\">astralbijection.github.io</a> takes you here!)</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/astralbijection/astrid.tech/actions\">Github Actions</a> workflow that automatically builds on every push to verify that my code compiles. Additionally, if there was a push to the <code>main</code> branch, it will publish the build output to the <a href=\"https://github.com/astralbijection/astralbijection.github.io\">astralbijection.github.io</a> repo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ux-design-methodology\">UX design methodology</h3>\n<p>I’ve tried to make the browsing experience as user-friendly and inclusive as possible by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adopting a mobile-first methodology for designing views, and responsively sizing elements in CSS</li>\n<li>Statically generating the site to reduce bandwidth consumption for users</li>\n<li>Utilizing semantic tags and designing the site to be accessible for screen readers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"backend\">Backend</h2>\n<p>Currently, the backend’s only functionality is to serve and receive possibly anonymous comments.</p>\n<p>I have pointed <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/astridyu/astrid_tech_api\">Docker Hub</a> at my repo to build, test, and release a new <code>:latest</code> image on every push to main.</p>\n<p>It is deployed as a Docker container on a <a href=\"https://contabo.com/\">Contabo</a> VPS located in Missouri for about $8/mo. See <a href=\"https://github.com/astralbijection/astrid.tech/blob/main/docker-compose.yml\">the <code>docker-compose.yml</code></a> for deployment details. I will soon set up <a href=\"https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower\">Watchtower</a> to automatically pull the image, so that the only thing I need to do with deployment is push to <code>main</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"content\">Content</h2>\n<p>The content is in its own <a href=\"https://github.com/astralbijection/astrid.tech-content\">Git submodule</a> as a set of raw files that get aggregated and compiled on each frontend build. It is written in the following file formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>YAML</li>\n<li>Jupyter notebooks for a few blog posts (I wrote a custom Gatsby plugin that auto-transforms the Jupyter notebooks into Markdown files)</li>\n</ul>","tags":["bootstrap-css","ci-cd","css","django","docker","gatsby-js","html","javascript","python","react-js","sass","typescript","website"]},"similar":[{"slug":"inventree","title":"Inventree"},{"slug":"collision-zone","title":"Collision Zone"},{"slug":"interactive-pid","title":"Interactive PID Simulator"},{"slug":"tanksberry-pi","title":"Tanksberry Pi"},{"slug":"quadfrost-leds","title":"QuadFrost 3D Printer System"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
